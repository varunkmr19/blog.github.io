# Introduction

PostgreSQL, or Postgres, is a relational database management system that provides an implementation of the SQL querying language. It’s standards-compliant and has many advanced features like reliable transactions and concurrency without read locks.

# Step 1 - Installing PostgreSQL

First we have to update our local package index

```bash
$ sudo apt update
```

Then, install the Postgres package along with a -contrib package that adds some additional utilities and functionality:

```bash
$ sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

Now that the software is installed, we can go over how it works.

# Step 2 - Using PostgreSQL Roles and Databases

By default, Postgres uses a concept called “roles” to handle authentication and authorization. These are, in some ways, similar to regular Unix-style accounts, but Postgres does not distinguish between users and groups and instead prefers the more flexible term “role”.

Upon installation, Postgres is set up to use ident authentication, meaning that it associates Postgres roles with a matching Unix/Linux system account. If a role exists within Postgres, a Unix/Linux username with the same name is able to sign in as that role.

The installation procedure created a user account called postgres that is associated with the default Postgres role. In order to use Postgres, you can log into that account.

# Switching Over to the postgres account

```bash
$ sudo -i -u postgres
```

You can now access the PostgreSQL prompt immediately by typing:

```bash
$ psql
```

From there you are free to interact with the database management system as necessary.

You can exit out of the PostgreSQL prompt by typing:

```bash
postgres=# \q
```

This will bring you back to the postgres Linux command prompt.

# Step 3 - Creating a New Role

Currently, you just have the postgres role configured within the database. You can create new roles from the command line with the **createrole** command. The **--interactive** flag will prompt you for the name of the new role and also ask whether it should have superuser permissions.

If you are logged in as the **postgres** account, you can create a new user by typing:

```bash
postgres@yourcomputername :~$ createuser --interactive
```

The script will prompt you with some choices and, based on your responses, execute the correct Postgres commands to create a user to your specifications.

```bash
Enter name of role to add: varun
Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) y
```

Your installation of Postgres now has a new user.
